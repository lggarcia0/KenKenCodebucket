I know ignorance is no good excuse, but it is the cause of my failure.
I ended doing this assignment alone, and it took me a long time to implement the methods.
For this, I am now 3 days late of the extended deadline with only the first two parts done.
I really wanted to implement local search, but just creating a better backtracking took me days to implement.
At this point, I am not sure if it is worth it to keep on working.
I just hope, that you could at least lessen my penalty as I am new to github and compiling things through the command prompt, which I know sounds rediculous coming from a computer science major.
