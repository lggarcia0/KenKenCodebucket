README

In order to run BTstarter (found in KenKen/src/starter) compile the code through command prompt and run it
It will ask you for a file and its file directory.
I included one called KenKenProblem.txt, which includes the the information of the sample problem.

In order to run BestBackTracking (found in KenKen/src/backtracking) compile the code through the command at the same time as the Square class. 
Like BTstarter it will ask you for the file.
